     <p>these are the projects that i created in the DIG200 class. I learned so many things on how to create Photoshop images, Premiere Pro Vidoes, and a website with html!</p>
    
<div class="section">
    <h5>this is my photoshop image i created with layers.</h5>

    <p>Originally, I wanted to make a fake PC game from the early 2000s, but i couldnt't really piece together what i wanted to do.<br> After looking around on the internet, there were two games that truly grasp my interest when designing this cover, those games were: "Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver" and "Neverwinter Nights". <br> The atmosphere that is presented in the cover combines the cover art of neverwinter nights and the dark, grim and moody world that is in soul reaver, to make something completely new!</p>

    <h5>here is my stop motion video i created with over 150 photographs.</h5>

    	</video>

        <p> As a kid, i absouletly adored stop motion. So when i had the chance to make something in a stop motion format, I was very excited! <br> I never knew how fun and easy it could be with all the right tools! <br> I wanted to have a characters fighting as my video, but due to time contraints, I choose to go woth a more simple idea!</p>


        <div class="section">
    <h5>this is my premire project video!</h5>

    <video width="480" controls>
    <source src="media/Asomani, Jalen - Short Film Project.mp4" border="10" height="400">
    </video>

    <p>this is a video that I made for a school projetc, although it is unfinshed, I am proud of myself for being able to create something in a software like premire pro within a few days!</p>
